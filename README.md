Final Project for APLN_552 - Special Topics in NLP

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook I used for my final project in APLN 552.
In order to use the code, you have to download the files from the OneStopEnglish Corpus:

Although this project is very limited in scope, I intend to use it as a foundation for future work on automatic readability assessment and paratextual resource generation.
